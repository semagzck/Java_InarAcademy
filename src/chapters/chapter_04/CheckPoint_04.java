Write an expression that obtains a random integer between 34 and 55. Write an expression that obtains a random integer between 0 and 999. Write an expression that obtains a random number between 5.5 and 55.5.

       (a) 34 + (int)(Math.random() * (55 - 34)i)

       (b) (int)(Math.random() * 1000)

       (c) 5.5 + (Math.random() * (55.5 - 5.5))
